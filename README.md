# IoT-App-Azure

The solution has two projects:

1) Device Registration Application - Connects to Azure IoT Hub and programmatically creates and registers a device with IoT Hub
2) Device Simulator - Uses the Azure Device SDK to simulate a device sending data to IoT Hub

Please change your Azure subscription details in App.config

Please download the Azure Device Explorer to view registered devices and validate data being sent from simulator to IoT Hub https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md
